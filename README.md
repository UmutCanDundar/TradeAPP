# TradeAPP (Developed with Qt)

TradeAPP is a desktop application that allows users to create accounts (similar to a banking system) and perform buy-sell operations.  
All user and transaction data is stored in a MySQL database.

In the future, the application will feature a trade simulation system powered by AI, designed to provide a realistic trading experience.

## 🚀 Project Purpose

This project is being developed as part of my self-education. Therefore:

- I have uploaded it on GitHub even though it is still under development.  
  📌 *The goal is to gain more experience with the GitHub workflow and version control.*

- The application is temporarily designed to run on a single machine.  
  🔧 *For now, the client and server logic are not separated.*

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- C++ / Qt Framework – for building the desktop GUI  
- MySQL – for database storage  
- (Planned) AI-based trade simulation logic

## 📌 Notes

- This project is a "work in progress" and updated continuously.
